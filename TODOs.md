1) Tell fabrice to add GA4 code to websites for tracking and how
- xauh.gold, herculis.gold, herculis.li

2) Current website classification sessions is not working, it all gets grouped into "Others" and shows 0s on all three websites, fix this

3) Verify that we are using the xauh TON address, the xauh pool address on CapitalDex, and the bot market maker on CapitalDex

4) Remove private telegram phone and api, if they still dont provide a company cellphone with phone number then they are not going to allowed to use my private one any longer

4.1) Remove Twitter API as well and swap out with new API to get with company email

4.2) Check for any other credential that's personal and needs to be revoked or replaced!!!

5) Add company logo somewhere

6) Make sure all data is now real data, no placeholder or testing data to be left

6.1) Make sure the daily syncs/crons work correctly for everything we need to sync

7) Prepare everything for migration to a different Vercel account, apparently vercel doesnt have a feature to easily export environment variables so they would have to be copied manually and there are many of them, also for the database I assume we would have to do manual cloning and then somehow handle the transfer on Neon as well. I want to immediately forbid them to keep this stuff on my personal account Vercel and Neon so if data loss occurs it´s not my issue, it was on them to provide me with proper infrastructure and accounts from the start.
